These scripts can be used in the Jenkins script console to provide a summary of previous builds. Just paste it into http://<jenkins-server>/script and click Run.

Different jobs/builds can be examined by commenting/uncommenting the lines at the top of the script or adding new values.

Some common errors have been added to the errors dictionary - if an error message does not match one of these strings, it is flagged as a new error. You can then add part of the message to the dictionary and run again so all similar errors are counted.

At the bottom of the summary is a section that can be copied and pasted into a spreadsheet, containing build number, error summary (from dictionary), count, test name, and full error message columns.
